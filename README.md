# Comparative-ML-Techniques-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project heart disease dataset was analyzed using 6 different ML algorithms. The dataset contains 13 features out of which 8 features are categorical and rest are numerical.
On these features Ml algorithms:
Logistic Regression
KNN
Random Forest
SVM
Decision Tree
XG-Boost Classifier
were applied and the recall value was choosen to select the best model.
SVM came out to be the best model with a recall of 90.27% with 10 fold cross validation and 88.75 % with 5 fold cross validation.
